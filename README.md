## 🍴 About this fork

This is a personal fork ([`rsb1813/open-paxhistoria`](https://github.com/rsb1813/open-paxhistoria)) of
[`Open-Historia/open-historia`](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia), developed independently
(not upstreamed). Changes on top of upstream:

- **Anthropic custom endpoint** — point the Anthropic provider at a self-hosted proxy that speaks the
  Messages API format (Settings → Anthropic → Endpoint), routed through the server relay for CORS safety.
- **Per-provider custom parameters** — a JSON field per AI provider merged into outgoing request bodies,
  for things like reasoning budget/effort limits the built-in UI doesn't expose.
- **Globe country-label fix** — country name labels no longer render oversized at high latitudes in 3D
  Globe mode; each label is now corrected for its own latitude, not the camera's.
- **Settings icon + country badge** — settings toggle is now "⋮", and the player's country shows as a
  small flag badge (bottom-right) instead of a text pill (custom/non-ISO polities fall back to a letter badge).
- **Community hub cover images + detail view** — scenario cards show a cover image when the hub post has
  one, and clicking a card opens a detail view with stats and an "Import & Play" button.
- **Map interaction & display settings** — a new Settings section with toggles for hiding country labels,
  disabling idle globe rotation, reversing scroll-zoom direction, and disabling pan inertia, plus sliders
  for zoom sensitivity, border width, and feature (label) size.
- **Sensitive flag blur** — an opt-in setting that blurs flags for a small list of commonly-disputed
  polities wherever a flag renders.
- **Installable as a PWA** — the app can be installed as a standalone app (works reliably from
  `localhost`; installing from a plain-HTTP LAN address may not prompt, since that isn't a secure context).

## 🚀 Installation

### Easiest

- **Windows:** double-click **`Launch Open Historia.bat`**
- **macOS:** double-click **`Launch Open Historia.command`** (first run: right-click → *Open*)
- **Linux:** run `./"Launch Open Historia.sh"` in a terminal

The launcher checks Node.js, downloads the map data, installs dependencies, builds,
and opens the game. To update an existing install later, run the matching
**`Update Open Historia`** script for your platform — it fetches the latest version
while preserving your saves, scenarios, and map data.

#### Android app (thin APK)

Easiest: download **`pax-historia.apk`** from the
[**Android release**](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/releases/tag/android)
and open it to install (allow installs from your browser when Android asks).
On first launch the app finds the Termux server on the same phone by itself;
to play against another machine, type its address once — it's remembered.
It's a thin client: the game itself runs on the server it connects to.

for it to work, you should have termux on your device setup

<details>
<summary>Build the APK yourself (needs the Android SDK)</summary>

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx cap sync android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug   # gradlew.bat on Windows
```

The APK lands in `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. (Or open
`mobile/android` in Android Studio and press Run.) Maintainers: the
**Build Android APK** action in the Actions tab builds and republishes the
release APK — run it after changing `mobile/`.

</details>

### Manual

Prerequisites: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsb1813/open-paxhistoria.git
cd open-paxhistoria
git lfs install        # Set up Git LFS
git lfs pull           # Pull large files (map tiles + editor seeds + world map)
npm install            # Install dependencies (includes OpenLayers etc. for the editor)
npm run build          # Build the client
node server/server.js  # Start the server
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> **Note:** the large map assets (`*.pmtiles`, `public/assets/*-seed.*`, and
> `server/data/scenarios/default/regions.geojson`) live in Git LFS. If you downloaded a
> ZIP instead of cloning, run the launcher script for your platform — it fetches them automatically.

## 🌍 Scenarios

**Modern Day** is the only built-in scenario. All other official presets — *WWII 1939*,
*Medieval 1200*, *Rome 117 AD*, *Mongol World 1300*, *New World 1650* — live on the
[**Scenario Hub**](https://github.com/Arkniem/pax-historia-scenarios), pinned at the top of
the in-game **Community** tab. Import any of them with one click, or publish your own.

To rebuild an official preset from source (specs live in `scripts/presets/`):

```bash
node scripts/presets/build-preset.mjs scripts/presets/wwii-1939.spec.mjs
```

To regenerate the built-in Modern Day map: `node scripts/build-default-map.mjs`

## 🗺️ Map editor

Open any scenario's editor and click **🗺️ Open Map Editor** (or visit
`http://localhost:3000/?editor=1` for the standalone editor). Draw regions, split and
merge borders freehand, paint owners, import 70k cities, sign your map, then
**Apply & Play**.
