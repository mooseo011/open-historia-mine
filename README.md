## 🚀 Installation

### Easiest (Windows)

Double-click **`Launch Pax Historia.bat`** — it checks Node.js, downloads the map data,
installs dependencies, builds, and opens the game.

### Manual

Prerequisites: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tommi-K//pax-historia.git
cd pax-historia
git lfs install        # Set up Git LFS
git lfs pull           # Pull large files (map tiles + editor seeds + world map)
npm install            # Install dependencies (includes OpenLayers etc. for the editor)
npm run build          # Build the client
node server/server.js  # Start the server
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> **Note:** the large map assets (`*.pmtiles`, `public/assets/*-seed.*`, and
> `server/data/scenarios/default/regions.geojson`) live in Git LFS. If you downloaded a
> ZIP instead of cloning, run the launcher `.bat` — it fetches them automatically.

## 🌍 Scenarios

**Modern Day** is the only built-in scenario. All other official presets — *WWII 1939*,
*Medieval 1200*, *Rome 117 AD*, *Mongol World 1300*, *New World 1650* — live on the
[**Scenario Hub**](https://github.com/Arkniem/pax-historia-scenarios), pinned at the top of
the in-game **Community** tab. Import any of them with one click, or publish your own.

To rebuild an official preset from source (specs live in `scripts/presets/`):

```bash
node scripts/presets/build-preset.mjs scripts/presets/wwii-1939.spec.mjs
```

To regenerate the built-in Modern Day map: `node scripts/build-default-map.mjs`

## 🗺️ Map editor

Open any scenario's editor and click **🗺️ Open Map Editor** (or visit
`http://localhost:3000/?editor=1` for the standalone editor). Draw regions, split and
merge borders freehand, paint owners, import 70k cities, sign your map, then
**Apply & Play**.
